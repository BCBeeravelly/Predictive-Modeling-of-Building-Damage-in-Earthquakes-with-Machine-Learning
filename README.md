# Earthquake Damage Prediction

## Abstract
Earthquakes can cause devastating damage to buildings, resulting in far-reaching consequences for human lives, social structures, and geographical landscapes. In this project, we present a machine learning approach to predict the damage grade of buildings impacted by earthquakes. We explore various machine learning algorithms for predicting and classifying damage grades and evaluate their performance. Our approach has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of earthquake damage prediction.

## Introduction
The devastating effects of earthquakes on buildings have far-reaching consequences on human lives, social structures, and geographical landscapes. Earthquakes can displace communities and populations, straining essential resources. As a result, it is crucial to predict the extent of building damage to develop effective prevention and mitigation strategies.

In this project, we aim to predict the damage grade of buildings impacted by earthquakes, focusing on the Gorkha earthquake that struck Nepal in 2015. Our methodology involves exploring various machine learning algorithms to predict and classify the damage grades of buildings. We preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical values. We then split the dataset into training and testing subsets and apply different classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and XGBoost, to evaluate their performance in predicting damage grades. We measure model performance using the micro-averaged F1 score. By accurately predicting building damage grades, we aim to provide valuable insights for urban planners, engineers, and disaster management agencies to develop better policies, construction guidelines, and early warning systems to minimize the loss of life and property during earthquakes.

## Related Work
Our project is based on an online challenge titled "Richterâ€™s Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage," hosted by DrivenData, a data science competition platform that hosts online challenges for social impact. This competition aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict damage levels for buildings affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake, using a dataset provided by the organizers.

Although no previous work has been conducted on this specific problem, there has been considerable research on earthquake damage prediction using machine learning techniques. Existing literature on similar problems and related techniques may inform our approach. For example, Wang et al. (2019) used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze post-earthquake images and predict the degree of building damage caused by earthquakes in China. Huang et al. (2020) used a deep neural network (DNN) approach to predict peak ground acceleration of earthquakes, which can be used to estimate building damage. Chong et al. (2019) used a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the degree of damage to buildings caused by earthquakes, using building and seismic data from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in Japan. Tymvios et al. (2020) used a random forest algorithm to predict the probability of building damage in Cyprus due to earthquakes, using building, geological, and seismic data.

Overall, the existing literature suggests that machine learning algorithms, including CNNs, DNNs, SVMs, and random forests, can be effective in predicting earthquake damage levels. These studies demonstrate the potential for these models to be applied in different contexts and regions.
